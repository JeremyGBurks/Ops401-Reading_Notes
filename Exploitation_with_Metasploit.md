### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class
Metasploit is an integral tool for any pen tester (and threat actor). Metasploit, as it was described in the article, is the swiss army knife of exploits and
payloads. It is an ever evolving tool that is deceptively easy to learn, difficult to master. In a program (Code Fellows) that focuses on pen testing and 
mitigating attacks in its latter half, this reading rates in the top 10 most important articles. Although it does not go into any detail regarding how to 
actually use Metasploit, it does provide a strong foundation to build off of as well as many links to helpful how-to readings.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from work/life
Metasploit is like a closet that holds a bunch of cleaning supplies. It houses many tools within it to complete specific jobs. Just opening the closet will 
not "clean" anything. To be an expert cleaner, you must know what tool (exploit) to use--broom, mop, duster, and additional solutions to increase the efficacy (payloads).
Metasploit isn't the broom or mop, and it doesn't make someone a hacker or pen tester, it just provides a convenient all in one package to access these tools.

### Things I want to know more about
I want to know more about everything Metasploit. I loved using it when we were pen testing. I want to know more about all the different exploits it has and 
how they can be used.
