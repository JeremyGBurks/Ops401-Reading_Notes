### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class this week
In this module this week we employed (on a very small and basic scale) malware analysis. We analyzed PCAPs from a sample malware and actually engaged in the first step in the Key Stages of Malware Analysis, "observing malware behavior". This reading was a really simple breakdown of something that is extremely complicated and dense. It was a helpful introduction to malware analysis


### Explanation of topic via an analogy from past life/work experience
Malware analysis is like getting food poisoning. You know the signs and symptoms. In order to understand where it came from and how to better avoid it next time you have to breakdown the timeline, isolate events, and analyze aspects of what seemed suspicious. 


### Things I want to know more about
I am really intrigued by malware analysis, so I am curious and want to learn as much about it as possible. 
I would be interested in looking into these tools to see how they work:
* CIRCL Dynamic Malware Analysis Platform (DMA) – a public service that lets you analyze malware in a controlled environment, securely upload sensitive documents, and perform advanced tasks like memory forensics. 
* Dinoflux – a malware analysis platform that studies behavior uses reverse engineering techniques and creates comfortable indicators of compromise outcomes, integrating with your security operations center (SOC). 
* Sndbox – a malware research platform powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced driver analysis, with an invisible agent that convinces the malware to reveal its full functionality.
