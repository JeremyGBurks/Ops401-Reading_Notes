# Part 2: Tracking, Detecting, and Thwarting PowerShell-based Malware and Attacks

### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class
Power shell is a widely used tool by system administrators and according to this article, PowerShell provides a great cover for fileless attacks that reside in the system memory. Powershell is so trusted and widely used and it provides access to all parts of a host via the .NET framework, it has become an ideal vessel to use to inject malicious payloads into running applications where the fileless malware can go undetected by common scans. It's important to be aware of these vulnerabilities if working in security. 

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from prior work/life experiences
The idea of bundling malware with a trusted application is like ordering a meal that you anticipate is going to be good and helpful then getting sick from it from an unexpected bacteria. 

### Things I want to know more about
According to this article, social engineering is often used to infect applications using power shell. I'm curious about how much providing education and awareness to administrators using power shell will help, or has helped, to reduce the number of successful PowerShell attacks.
