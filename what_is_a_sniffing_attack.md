### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class
This reading is an important adjunct to the final subjects being taught in Ops401. Sniffing attacks and how to recognize and mitigate them is an important
base of knowledge for any security professional. This article was an easy read and went into the basics of what a sniffing attack is, what types of sniffing attacks there are (active and passive), network attack implementations, and vulnerable protocols. I found it especially helpful to see how it can be used in a network in different "flavors" of attacks (DNS poisoning, Evil twin, MAC spoofing).

### Explanation of the topic via an analogy from work/home life
Sniffing attacks are similar to someone hanging outside your door listening in on conversations. It is essentially a breach of confidentiality, this individual can intercept the conversation going on and then relay it to someone else in whatever way they want.

### Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about the details on how these attacks are carried out. I am very intrigued with PCAPs and Wireshark so I would love to know more
about how to recognize a sniffing attack through Wireshark.
