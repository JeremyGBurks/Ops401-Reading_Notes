### Why this topic matters in relation to topics covered in lecture this week
Comprehensive DLP seems to be a cornerstone of any strong information security program/department. We are utilizing DLP software in our upcoming lab which
will help bring a deeper understanding to all the configurations that can be made in a DLP program. Having a working knowledge of DLP (tools and processes),
we will better understand the full scope of what is at risk and how to better protect sensitive data.

### Summary of article/topic via an analogy from past work/life experience
DLP is similar to retail loss prevention programs in some ways. In a prior retail job there were loss prevention policies and tools that we used to
prevent major company losses (primarily financial). These programs and tools were regularly assessed for their efficacy and were part of the training 
process during onboarding. In this example the loss was not company data, but product. Instead of employing an application/program, we implemented other techniques 
to curb the loss of store property. Much like DLP, loss prevention is integral to a company to help prevent significant financial losses and protect key 
resources/products/data.

### Things I would like to know more about
All the configurations that can be made with DLP software to catch sensitive information leaks or possible breaches. Digital Guardian (the company that 
wrote the article) states that they employ 24-7 analysts to review data streams. I am curious if they are similar to SOC analysts?
