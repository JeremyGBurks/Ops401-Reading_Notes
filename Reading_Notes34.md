### Why this topic matters in relation to topics covered in this module
We have been working our way through the module and have come to the last two labs that have heavily leaned into the cyber forensics aspect. We have utilized
tools like Wireshark (and T-shark), Zeek, and Rita, and most recently, Autopsy. This reading really provides an overview of what a Cyber Forensics Specialist does, why they are
needed, their job duties, skills required, and average pay.

### Explanation of the topic via an analogy from past life/work experiences
Cyber Forensics is like my prior job doing utilization review. I would do forensic charting by looking through the Pt's chart for clinical rationale. This 
is similar to the detective/investigatory aspects of Computer Forensics. Gathering evidence with an end goal of trying to solve a problem.

### Things I want to know more about
I am really interested in analyst work, I think some of those aspects are present in digital forensics as well so I am very interested in knowing more about the 
different tools they use.
