### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in this module
This current module we are in is on web application security. We have used different tools to assess and test web application security. Zed appears similar to 
to "W3af" in that it takes in a URL and scans it for vulnerabilities, however, Zed appears much more powerful and implements ajax as well. This reading outlines
the basic functions of this very dense tool.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from life/work experience
Zed is similar to performing a substance use disorder (SUD) assessment. Zed takes in a URL and scans the web application using numerous configured tools to find vulnerabilities.
When you do an SUD assessment, you take in clinical (data) and are looking for clinical markers of substance use dependence, much like Zed looks for web vulnerabilities.
At the end of the scan, Zed can compile the data into a report that is easily read and used to implement security controls. At the end of an SUD assessment, the
clinical is compiled into an assessment summary that is used to obtain treatment authorizations and help the treatment team make case management decisions.

### Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about the different options and configurations that can be made within Zed. It seems like a very powerful (open source) tool that
can take significant amounts of time to learn all of the options.
