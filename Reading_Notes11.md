## "Is Cybersecurity Automation The Future?"

### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in this module
This reading likely dovetails into the next module we are starting this week. We just completed the module on cryptography, it is highly likely that this next module will focus on cybersecurity automation and SIEM logging tools. This particluar reading is really straight forward high-level explantion/introduction to automation which will create the foundation of this coming module.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from past work/life experience
Cybersecurity automation and its use cases (creating automation to take care of repetitive and mundane tasks that are prone to human error) is similar to some of the work I have done in my prior jobs. I created automated forms that would poplate the client's name, demographics, date, and reporting source when I was in charge of a case-load of over 70 clients. This automation not only sped up the entire monthly reporting process, it resulted in noticably less occurences of human error in data entered, and allowed me the extra time to focus on more creative problem solving and counseling with my caseload. Although this was not "security" focused in nature, it did have implications on data confidentiality and integrity; when sending out monthly reports it was imperative that the client/patient information was correct and accurate and sent to the appropriate reporting authority. This mandate was part of the HIPPA guidlines. To ensure that the correct clinical data was sent to the correct sources, this automation of reporting was utilized to help maintain compliance. 

### Things I want to know more about
I would love to continue learing more about automation and SIEM tools. I am really interested in the SOC analyst role.
