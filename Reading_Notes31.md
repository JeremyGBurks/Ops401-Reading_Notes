### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class this week
This reading directly ties into the lab we just completed this weekend. It actually would have been helpful to read this prior to doing the lab. We used Yara to write our own custom rules which was actually sort of fun to learn the syntax and test to see if the rule was working correctly. Something that I found interesting in this reading was "YARA rules are only as good as the information they are based on. If attackers change up some of their code and features, defenders may have to write new YARA rules."

### Explanation of the topic via an analogy from past life/work experience
It's like being trained to check IDs; you are scanning for words, birthdates, and looking at the picture in comparison to the person. You are having to learn how to check various data points within the identification to confirm its validity. You won't catch problems if you aren't "trained" to look for them.


### Things I want to know more about
I would like to learn more about the different ways to write yara rules and practice using them like a pro
I would also like to learn more about its integration with ClamAV
