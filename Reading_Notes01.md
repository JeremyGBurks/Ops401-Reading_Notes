This topic and reading is the foundation for the the first class/module and provides the framework for the first lab assignment. As I was reading this this article I found a wealth of information to plug into my security policies and procedures document.

### Summary with an analogy
SOC 2 compliance is much like the surprise Department Of Health (DOH) audits that would occur regularly in behavioral healthcare. They deal primarily with protected health information (PHI), documentation, and compliance with state and federal laws and RCW (Revised Code of Washington). Similar in some ways to the SOC 2 audits, the DOH audits are looking for breaches in confidentiality, integrity of chart notes and the overall adherence to standardized practices.
