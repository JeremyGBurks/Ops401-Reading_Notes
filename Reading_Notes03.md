### Why this topic matters
This topic is the absolute _**foundation**_ to cybersecurity. It is so incredibly important to understand risk management/assessment/analysis and their part within the CIA triad. This reading was really helpful in further defining topics that were introduced in lecture on Saturday. It ties in directly with lab 03. I read this article 2 times to make sure that I understood some of the key takeaways.

### Summarize via an analogy from previous experience
This article explores risk analysis within cyber security, which is similar to the intake assessments at my prior job. I would (as an assessor) perform an intake assessment, each of the 6 "dimensions" covered a different aspect of a person (biomedical, psychological ect) and within those dimensions were risk ratings. A risk rating is where you combined subjective data i.e. clinical impression with objective data (medical diagnostics, vitals, symptoms, lab results). At the end of the evaluation I would assess the risk and determine the best course of treatment to mitigate further risk. I would perform a thorough _assessment_, I would _analyze_ the results, and _manage_ risk by diagnosing and recommending a level of care for treatment.
