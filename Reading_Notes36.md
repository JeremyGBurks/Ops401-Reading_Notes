### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in this module
Having a comprehensive understanding of cross site scripting (XSS) and its variants is important in understanding web application security and vulnerability
management. In the prior lab we actually used Reflective XSS on a vulnerable web application. The process of getting to try out javascript commands to get
the desired result while checking the source code was really informative. XSS has some similarities to SQL injection which is a type of attack that we will be 
learning soon.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from past life/work experiences
To be honest, I could not think of an analogy from personal work/life experience so I chose an analogy that easily explains XSS.
XSS is like when you go to a buffet and you eat food that you feel as though you should trust, but it's secretly undercooked and maybe poisoned. 
After eating it you get really sick; the person who undercooked the food comes into your house and starts breaking things and impersonating you.

### Things I want to know more about
I am really intrigued by XSS and SQL injection, I would love to know more about these subjects out of curiosity. They are extraordinarily complex and ever changing.
