### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class this week
One of the final modules we have in the Ops401 program is just summarizing all the topics regarding pen testing and exploring the different stages of it. This 
reading explains the topic of pen testing in a very simple straightforward way that describes the different stages and types. I found this reading really easy to 
follow and understand. This reading matters simply because for us to understand pen testing, we need to have knowledge about the stages of a pen test as well as the 
different types of tests and outcomes.

### Explanation of the topic via an analogy from work/home experience
The only example analogy I could come up with that was accurate was one that didn't come from personal experience. Pen testing is similar to the process in a big movie heist leading up to the job.
In order for the heist to be successful, the team needs to run tests, get possible floor plans, know where the alarms are, what shifts the guards are working.
They perform practice runs and develop a plan in stages. They poke and prod at systems to uncover vulnerabilities and flaws in order to exploit them.

### Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about the tools used at each stage. This topic is very deep and it is always changing, as are the tools used in pen tests.
