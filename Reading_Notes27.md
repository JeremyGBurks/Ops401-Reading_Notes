### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class this week
This reading matters as we are going to be utilizing Powershell Empire in our next lab. To get a comprehensive understanding of Red Team tactics and the use of this framework
it is important to have some history on it and its uses. This article was really helpful in better understanding what its original purpose was and why it was
retired. I found it particularly interesting how something so lightweight and powerful was regarded as helpful from both sides of the fight-- it could be used
to help and for harm.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from past life/work experience/knowledge
Powershell Empire is like two way radios for cops, in the right hands these devices and the messages sent through them can help save lives, however, if these messages/transmissions
are intercepted and exploited by a criminal, they can gain a significant advantage over the law.
Powershell Empire was a very powerful framework that in the right hands helped pen testers understand vulnerabilities in their system and simulate attacks,
in the wrong hands it caused significant damage.

### Things I want to know more about
I want to know more about everything pen testing and red team. I am deeply intrigued at how this framework can be used for persistence.
