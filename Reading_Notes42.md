## Ethics in Tech

### "Amazon Workers Demand Jeff Bezos Cancel Face Recognition Contracts With Law Enforcement"
This topic was, and still is, a very important topic regarding the use of tech for surveillance. This article illuminates the double edged sword of having 
cloud computing, AI, and machine learning. These technologies are not intrinsically bad; they are, however, tools that can be used for a means of control.
It is unclear if the developers foresaw that these tools would be used in this manner, I would definitely say that the decision to sell the use of them to 
ICE and Law enforcement was a financial decision by Amazon and not a moral one (at least I hope). The decision to continue business with ICE and law enforcement after 
discovering how they are being utilized, absolutely has moral ties. When I was reading this, one thing kept coming to me over and over; this technology is 
very similar to a gun. When no one is using it, it's just a tool. When someone who means to cause harm, destruction, or control obtains one, the results are devastating.

### "The cybersecurity risk of self-driving cars"
This article discusses the cybersecurity implications of autonomous cars. It is a fascinating subject that falls within the realm of IoT devices and the
attack surfaces they inherently have being connected to everything around them. Cybersecurity needs to continue being a focus in the development cycle when
creating products that have internet connectivity, period. Most electronics can be hacked in one form or another, and the landscape of threats is always changing,
I think that it is a valid concern when we are discussing self-driving vehicles that have complete control over everything. If there isn't already, there needs
to be cybersecurity technicians on staff wherever these vehicles go to get serviced or within their 24-hour on-call team to be able to parse through data being 
sent to and from the vehicles to assess for possible malicious activity. Aside from the extremely obvious hazard of autonomous driving, there are other aspects
of vehicles that can be hacked to give an attacker information, such as rear view cameras and in car microphones. In conclusion, if it connects to the internet,
It likely has a vulnerability. If that vulnerability affects the very physical safety of yours (and possibly your children), and others on the road, then it is time to 
make cybersecurity for automobiles a regular topic of conversation.
