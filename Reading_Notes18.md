### Why this topic matters in relation to topics covered in class this week
We have learned in the prior module how to use SIEM tools such as Splunk to analyze logs. This reading directly ties into the lab we are going to be doing
tomorrow, instead of using Splunk, we will be utilizing AWS CloudWatch to monitor and log data from EC2 instances.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from past work/life experiences
CloudWatch is similar to a video surveillance system. It can be set in an area that catches all traffic coming in and going out. It can give you 
metrics from knowing when people are coming in and out. On some camera systems they have the ability to set up alarms that can be triggered by certain
events (movement or noise). These can be fine tuned and logs can be retrieved for analysis. Just as a security camera doesnt stop a break-in, it does
provide peace of mind to have timestamped logs of events happening.

### Things I want to know more about
All things cloud security. I am deeply interested in SOC analysis work so I love pouring through logs and just seeing what I can see, parsing out data,
and following trails.
