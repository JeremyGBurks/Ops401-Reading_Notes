## "What is VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)?"

### Why this topic matters in relation to topics covered in lecture this week
This module deals primarily with cloud security. Our past few labs have utilized SIEM tools that were parsing data from an AWS attack. Our next lab was 
setting up IAM users, groups, and inline policies. The upcoming lab has up set up cloud infrastructure utilizing a VPC with to subnets and EC2 instances
in both. This reading helps give a straightforward easy to follow look at what a VPC is and what it does for cloud security. 

### Explanation of topic via an analogy 
A VPC is like a gated community. It has residents and can function in itself and people on the inside can obviously go outside. It does, however, control
the flow of who comes in. People must be approved and go through an outer perimeter in order to access the residents and building on the inside. Access 
is largely determined by a more "global" or "communal" set of rules and physical walls both acting like a firewall.
