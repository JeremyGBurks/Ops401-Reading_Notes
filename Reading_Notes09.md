## "What is PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)?"

### Why this topic matters in relation to topics covered in this module
PKI fits in with this module where we have been learning about cryptography and data loss prevention. PKI uses key pairs to authenticate entities,
these keys are digitally signed off on through the certificate authority (CA). This is all extremely relevent when learning about data security in transit and at rest.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from prior work or life experience
PKI is similar to the counseling credentials I obtained in prior work. When the credentials are issued, the issuing body has a copy of those credentials as well as the
individual who is issued them (i.e. like key pairs). These credentials are used to authenticate your work, they are used when signing medical documents to
"prove" your identity and access/write medical charting. The credentials are approved and moniterd by the Department of Health (each signature can be traced back to the owner),
which in this case the Department of Health would be similar to the CA. As stated in the Professor Messor video for this reading, PKI is built upon trust, trust that is
backed up by certifyiong authorities and key pairs.

### Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about key pairs and gain a much better understanding of cryptography. It is a subject that is both intriguing, but also an area that I feel
I could use more working knowledge in.
