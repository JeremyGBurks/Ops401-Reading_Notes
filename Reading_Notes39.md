### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered this week
We have transitioned to a new module that is leaning heavy into SQL (SQL injection attacks etc). This reading is a comprehensive (sometimes comedic) breakdown
of what SQL is, what it can do, and why it is important to recognize its inherent vulnerabilities. This reading walks through some of the basic SQL commands,
different flavors of SQL, and use cases. I found it particularly helpful to see the SQL commands written out with the explanations below. The article went into great
detail on how this structured query language is both powerful and dangerous at the same time (like powershell). The end of the article covered ways that you can
help mitigate risk of SQL injection type attacks. 


### Explanation of topic via an analogy from work/life experience
SQL is similar to a grocery list (albeit a very structured organized one), when it is written it is essentially a table with items or attributes in column.
You would pair all the fruits together so that when you are in the produce section and pull up the list you can easily search and pull "Fuji apples, Bananas, Kiwi, Oranges"
off the list and add them to your cart. With this in mind, a SQL injection attack is similar to your child getting a hold of the list and "injecting" the word 
"cookies" into the list in your handwriting. You would then, naturally trust this list and when queried for items in that category, would put cookies into your
cart. 


### Things I want to know more about
I want to learn more about SQL and practice with writing SQL commands. I did some very basic SQL lessons prior to starting Code Fellows, but I would like to have a much
deeper understanding of this language.
