### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class
This reading matters as we utilized GuardDuty in our most recent lab. We used it in conjunction with other AWS tools to analyze sample data sets in order
to see how the tool works and what data we could extract from the logs. 

***

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from prior work/life experiences
GuardDuty is much like a smartwatch/Fitbit. It is continuously monitoring various data points such as heart rate, sleep schedule, breathing patterns
ect and comes up with an overall report on your wellbeing. It compares abnormalities to known patterns to give insights into potential problems.
