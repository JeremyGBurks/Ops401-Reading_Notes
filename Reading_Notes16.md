## "Lessons Learned From the Capital One Breach"

### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class this week
This topic Directly relates to the prior lab 14 using Splunk where we sifted through data to find out how an attack on AWS cloud infrastructure occured. 
This topic also ties into lab 16 where we were tasked with creating users, groups, inline policies, and attaching policies to corresponding groups.
This helped me gain a much better idea of how IAM works. This reading/document outlined how this massive data breach occurred, it was really interesting 
how it laid out all the aspects of this attack and how they accessed the resources using AWS IAM. 

### Explanation of the topic using an analogy from past life/work experiences
Being in the healthcare industry I understand the lengths that you have to go to to ensure that data is secure, as well as the different mistakes 
that people/organizations can make to allow PHI to be exposed. It is like having a medical charting system and not having any safeguards up, 
not realizing the scale of damage until it is too late and data has been exposed.

### Things I want to know more about
I love the analysis aspect of cybersecurity so looking at the data and sequence of events is really interesting to me. I liked this reading and would like 
to continue to learn more about cloud based attacks and ways to mitigate damage.
