### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered this week
This week we moved on from the module on SIEM tools and have transitioned to NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems) and IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems).
It ties in with SIEM tools and event logging as they work together to form a comprehensive network security system. This article very simply lays out
what an NIDS, HIDS, IPS are and what functions and services they provide. It is important for us to gain a solid foundation of knowledge about NIDS and
IPS as we will be implementing a NIDS in lab 14 and setting rules to alert for ICMP traffic. All of the prior knowledge regarding network structure
and protocols comes into play with this topic and helps solidify previously introduced topics.

### Explanation of the topic using an analogy from past work/life experiences
The reading gave an interesting analogy about NIDS stating that they act much like a fire alarm. I found that in all the places I have worked, they have
implemented fire drills using the fire alarm system. This system (with the exception of the sprinkler system) does not function to put the fire out,
mainly it is to alert staff that there is an emergency. It is also similar to a car alarm in that it doesn't necessarily stop a car thief, merely 
alerts people to their presence. An IPS is is similar to the analogy regarding the fire alarm, though in this analogy an IPS would include sprinkler 
systems, fire extinguishers, and regular fire drills. While these are important for alerting and mitigating damage, unless they are properly utilized
by trained professionals, they may not do much (this doesn't mean they are not extremely important).

### Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about NIDS, IPS, HIDS and how an attacker may use protocol based attacks to bring down a NIDS.
