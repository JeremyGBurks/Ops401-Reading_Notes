### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class
In the past few weeks we have been rounding out our foundational pen testing knowledge, the intruduction of Mimikatz is an amazing addition to the massive 
labrary of possible tools to use. This tool seems extremely powerful when used to steal credentials, escalate privledges, and view/save Kerberos tickets.
One thing that stuck out to me in this reading was "Defending against Mimikatz can be challenging because in order for an attacker to execute, 
theyâ€™ve already obtained root access on a Windows box. Oftentimes you may only be containing the damage the attacker has already caused."
I think that illuminates the power of this tool.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy
Mimikatz is similar to leaving your keys on the ground. A random person can take those keys and use them to enter restricted areas in the building. If they
had a "Golden ticket" it would be like getting a permanent personal access door to access any area you like. Passing the ticket is similar to using someone's
RFID badge. In all of these instances, the attacker (or intruder) is already inside the building so it is about containing damage and implementing 
security changes to help defend against this.

### Things I want to know more about
I am really intrigued by Kerberos tickets, and passing the hash.
I would like to know more about the additional modules that can be used with Mimikatz
