## "DEFINITION OF DATA IN TRANSIT VS. DATA AT REST"

### Why this topic matters
Learning about encryption and the vital role it plays in the protection of data in transit and at rest ties directly in to the lectures, labs, and ops challenges presented this week. We have been diving into cryptography and hashing so this very short read was a great adjunct to what has been covered this week and in this module. 

### Explanation via an analogy from prior work or home experience
The security implications and recommendations of data in transit and at rest is similar to apects of one of my prior jobs. I used to work as a professional courier and their were different "security" concerns regarding parcels in transity versus where they would be stored or their destination. Mail/parcels had to be locked up in P.O. boxes at rest; only specific people could have keys to the boxes. While in transit, they were loaded in my van and would be secured in the back protected by locking doors and a security gate. There were specific securoty controls implemented at both levels to help maintain security for sensitve mail/parcels. 

### Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about all the different types of encryption algorythms and what they do to obfuscate data.
