### Why these readings matter in relation to topics covered in class
These readings were extremely important in regards to topics covered in class. Following our module on log clearing and other TTP, this topic is extremely
relevent. Threat modeling is an integral part of security and uses the knowledge gained from all prior topics to help us understand a system better from 
web applications, data servers, to network layouts and more. Some of the interesting points that I picked up from the readings were:  
1. Threat modeling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value.
2. Threat modeling is a planned activity for identifying and assessing application threats and vulnerabilities.
3. A possible threat exists when the combined likelihood of the threat occurring and impact it would have on the organization create a significant risk
4. STRIDE Framework (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)


### Explanation of topics via an analogy from prior work/home experiences
Threat modeling is like mapping out a hike. The map and guides are used to identify, communicate, and assess threats (like cliffs or rockslides or other
potential hazards). Using this information, a team of people can begin to form a plan and prepare for certain issues so that their hike is as safe as possible.
But much like threat hunting, no hike is completely void of all threats regardless of the prep involved.

The four question framework: 
What are we working on?  
What can go wrong?  
What are we going to do about it?  
Did we do a good job?
