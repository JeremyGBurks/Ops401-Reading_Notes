### Why this topic matters in relation to topics covered in this module
Threat hunting is a major topic in this module. This is the second set of readings/videos regarding threat hunting which is a massive/dense topic that can take years 
to learn about. These videos were helpful in detailing proactive and active aspects of threat hunting as well as how tools like SIEM tools are reactive

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from past life/work experience
Threat hunting as it is explained in the videos is like preemptive car maintenance. You go into an active system armed with a knowledge of how the parts work 
together and what possible problems may occur. You proactively address issues like replacing air filters or worn tires, before a major problem occurs rather than
a reactive stance which would be replacing a flat tire.

### Things I want to know more about
As stated above, threat hunting is a massive subject that is like a moving train. It is ever-evolving and has endless depth. I would love to know more about
all the tools used to proactively hunt threats, though, I am really more interested in reactive (SIEM tools).
