## "Applying The CIA Triad To Your Enterprise File Transfer"

### Why this topic matters
The CIA triad is the foundation of information security. Having a working knowledge of its integration and relation to data transmission is extremely important.
This reading pairs with lab 06, where we use SFTP and SCP for file secure file transfers with encryption.

***

### Explanation of topic via an analogy
The CIA triad application to file transfer is akin to HIPPA in my prior work. There are parts of HIPPA that relate to the transport of protected health information.
The strict guidelines within HIPPA set a standard that helps keep health information confidential, free from tampering, and available for use when needed.

### Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about SFTP and its use cases. I am curious if it is used with PHI (Protected Health Information).

## "What Are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 Hashes, and How Do I Check Them?"

### Why this topic matters
Hashes are extremely important when understanding cryptography and information security as a whole. It is directly related to the reading above that 
discussed the CIA triad and data transit. Hashes protect data confidentiality and maintain integrity.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from past work experience
I am unable to think of a past work/life experience that I can draw on that is relative to hashing. I know that it uses algorithms to scramble data so that it
becomes a fixed length regardless of the original text length. 

***

### Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about all the different hashing algorithms and their level of security as I know that a handful of them are deprecated.
