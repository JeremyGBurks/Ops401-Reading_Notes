### Why this topic matters in relation to topics covered this week
The new module we started this week deals with SIEM tools and logging, this is all related to Security Operations Centers and their functions. A SOC 
needs SIEM tools to parse through massive amounts of network data to look for vulnerabilities and signs of intrusion. The next three labs deal with
Splunk which is a popular SIEM tool.

### Explanation of topic using an analogy from past work/life experience
An SOC functions similar to security teams that often operate in retail settings. In one of my prior jobs I had regular contact with the security 
team regarding possible shoplifters and other security related concerns. The security team worked out of a central location, a location that housed
security equipment (or tools), like security cameras and intrusion detection equipment. The individuals working in the security center had to 
watch over numerous camera feeds, taking in many details and using other sources to create a full picture of a situation. Their response depended on
their skillful use of the tools they were provided. If an SOC is like a security center, then the SIEM tools are the security cameras, radios, and 
intrusion detection equipment.

### Things I want to know more about
I have been extremely intrigued with the role of a security analyst in an SOC, this entire module is an area that I want to learn as much as possible 
about to better determine if this is a role that I want to continue to pursue
