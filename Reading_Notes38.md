### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in this module
This reading helps draw lines between ZAP and Burp Suite regarding their abilities to scan web applications. Burp Suite has some features that stand out against
ZAP. One of the main aspects that differentiates it is the ability to actively stop HTTP requests and edit them prior to sending. Burp Suite is a feature
dense program with a lot of capabilities that make it easy to configure it as a web proxy and intercept requests. This makes testing web app vulnerabilities 
very streamlined.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy
Burp Suite is like a carpenter's tool belt. It has lots of different tools that are easily accessible. Some of which are very advanced, and take years to master. If you know
how to utilize a specific tool for a specific job, you will not only be able to complete the job quicker, but the results will look better and be more thorough.

### Things I want to know more about
I'm really intrigued by these web app pen testing tools, They have so many features that you could spend hours diving into. I would would like to have more
practice with SQL injection and XSS and being able to scan for these vulnerabilities.
