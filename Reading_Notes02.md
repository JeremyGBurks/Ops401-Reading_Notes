### Why this topic matters
This topic matters as we are likely going to start movinging more into cloud infrastructure security. This reading did not mention much about security principals, mainly only levels of cloud computing abstraction. 

***

### Summarize via analogy
This reading explains the spectrum of cloud computing through levels of abstraction (bare metal to function abstraction). This is similar to the continuum of care (or Levels of care in my current job).  As one moves through the continuum of care, up and down through the levels, the intensity of services change and become more involved and are based on patient needs and presentation.

### Things I want to know more about
I was able to follow along when he went into EC2 and Lightsail. I would like to know more about the other services he mentioned: AWS Lambda, EKS, ECS, and EC2 i3.metal.
