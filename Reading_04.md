## CIS Benchmarks

### Why this topic matters in relation topics covered this week
We began discussing hardening systems in class 04. This was a smooth transition from SOC 2 reports and risk analysis. 
The 7 categories of CIS Benchmarks and 2 profile levels outline a framework that is comprehensive and easy to follow. This reading is directly tied into the lab:04
where we use the CIS benchmarks to harden a Windows Server. 

### Summary via an analogy from past work
CIS Benchmarks are basically peer reviewed configurations for security best practices. The 7 CIS categories are used to represent core tecnologies and within them are over
140 Benchmarks that set standards for system hardening. These categories and objectives within them are similar to ASAM (American Society of Addiction Medicine)
Levels of care. There are 5 broad levels of care in ASAM. Within those broad levels are smaller levels and services offered. Each one of these levels
set a standard of care and are recognized nationally. They set a benchmark for patient care. 


### Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about the 140 different benchmarks, and which of them are automatically enabled on different OS, and which are not clearly indicated to the wider public but are 
best practice for security professionals.
