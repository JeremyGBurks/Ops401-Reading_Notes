### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered this week
The next module following SIEM tools is likely on forward/reverse proxy servers and their application within cyber security. This article was helpful
in putting both types of proxy servers into easy to understand terms. The parts that stuck out to me as important regarding cybersecurity were the 
applications of proxy servers to help defend against DDoS attacks and taking care of encryption and decryption tasks.

### Explanation of topic via an analogy from past work/life experience
A forward proxy server is like having a lawyer. They act as a middle man between two parties. Information comes from one person and is 
intercepted and relayed to the other person--all data goes through them. A reverse proxy is farily similar, however, in this instance the lawyer is 
representing the other party. Nothing gets to the other party without going through their lawyer first.

### Things I want to know more about
I would like to see reverse proxy severs in action, they sound extremely interesting and important to cybersecurity. I would also like to know more
about how they fit in the picture with SIEM tools.
